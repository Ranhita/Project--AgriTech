# Project--AgriTech

Frontend prototype of a smart farming web dashboard that combines AI disease prediction concepts and simulated LoRa microclimate monitoring into an interactive interface.
This version focuses on UI/UX design and dashboard visualization for agricultural advisory systems.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a web interface designed for farmers to:

- Upload crop leaf images for disease analysis
- View simulated microclimate sensor readings
- Receive crop advisory suggestions
- Monitor environmental trends through charts

The system is designed as a frontend prototype demonstrating how AI-driven smart farming platforms can function in real-world scenarios.

Current Version: **Frontend prototype (backend integration in progress)**
